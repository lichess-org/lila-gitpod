# Welcome to Lichess on Gitpod

> Your development environment is now building.

You can watch the progress in the 3 terminal tabs that are running below:

1. `setup`: Sets up your configs, seeds your test database, and builds static assets
2. `lila-ws`: Starts the websocket server
3. `lila`: Starts the main Lichess server

It will take about 8-10 minutes.

Open a new terminal ("+" icon) and type `gp ports list`. When port 9663 says "open", click the link next to port 8080 to open your development site.

For test logins and other notes, see https://lichess-org.github.io/lila-gitpod/
