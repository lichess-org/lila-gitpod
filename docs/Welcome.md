# Welcome to Lichess on Gitpod

Your development environment is now building.

You can watch the progress in the 3 terminal tabs that are running below:

    1. `setup`: Seeds your test database, builds static assets, and sets up your configs
    2. `lila-ws`: Starts the websocket server
    3. `lila`: Starts the main Lichess server

It will take about 10 minutes.

Open a new terminal and type `gp url 9663` to get the URL of your dev site. See `docs/Developing.md` for test logins and other notes.
