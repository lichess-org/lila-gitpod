# Sharing

## Making your development site public

By default, you're the only one who can view your Lichess dev site. If you want to make it available to others or if you're developing an API client application, you can make ports `9663` and `9664` public.

Click the Remote Explorer icon on the left menu column, then change the port visibility to public for `9663` and `9664`.

!!! attention

    Your workspace will automatically stop after you've been idle for 30 minutes, at which point your URL will return an error.

## Collaborating

It is also possible to share your workspace to work on the same code with someone else.

See Gitpod's documentation for more on [sharing a running workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration#sharing-running-workspaces).
