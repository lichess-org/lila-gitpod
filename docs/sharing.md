# Sharing

## Making your development site public

By default, your Lichess dev site is only accessible by you. If you want to make it available to others or if you're developing an API client application, you can make port `8080` public.

Click the Remote Explorer icon on the left menu column, then change the port visibility to public for `8080`. You can keep the others private.

!!! attention

    Your workspace will automatically stop after you've been idle for 30 minutes, at which point your URL will return an error.

## Collaborating

It is also possible to share your workspace to work on the same code with someone else.

See Gitpod's documentation for more on [sharing a running workspace](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/sharing-and-collaboration#sharing-running-workspaces).
