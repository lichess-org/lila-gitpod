Consider using a lila-gitpod workspace while you develop your API integration before pointing to the production Lichess.org.

- Avoid getting rate-limited
- Don't worry about messing anything up
- If developing a bot, keep test games out of your bot's game history

## Setup

1. [Create your workspace](getting-started.md)
2. [Make port 8080 public](sharing.md), so you can access it from the client.

## Bot Development

1.  Create an account for your bot
2.  Point your bot to use your workspace's development site instead of `lichess.org`

    !!! info "Using lichess-bot"

        If you're using the [lichess-bot](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot) project, set the [`url` value in `config.yml`](https://github.com/ShailChoksi/lichess-bot/blob/master/config.yml.default) to your development site.

## Client Development

If you're using the Lichess [berserk](https://github.com/lichess-org/berserk) Python client, you can point it to your workspace's development site instead of `lichess.org`.

```python
import berserk

client = berserk.Client(base_url="https://your-gitpod-instance.gitpod.io")

profile = client.users.get_by_id('bobby')
print(profile)
```
