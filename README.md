## Lichess.org Development Environment

You can use Gitpod (a free, online, VS Code-like IDE) for contributing. With a single click, it will launch a workspace and automatically:

- Clone the necessary Lichess repositories
- Install all the dependencies
- Seed your database with test data
- Start lila

So that you can start contributing within a few minutes.
